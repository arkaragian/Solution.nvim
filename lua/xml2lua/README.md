# xml2lua 
Solution.nvim uses the xml2lua xml parser. Sources found here were copied from
the original repository. The commit used was:

https://github.com/manoelcampos/xml2lua/commit/f0c50d459e370338333d1ba312f384e515a7fbd1

future releases may update the xml2lua library with future commits.

## Modifications
The only modification made in the files would be the addition of an `init.lua`
file that makes the necesary requirements. As well as changes to paths. Those
are all included in one commit.
